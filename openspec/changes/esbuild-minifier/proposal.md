# Proposal

## Why

The production build of `client-v2` runs out of memory on Vercel's standard
build machine (8 GB) and is killed with SIGKILL. The cause is Terser, the
minifier Create React App ships with. `terser-webpack-plugin` runs its workers
as threads inside the webpack process (`enableWorkerThreads: true`), one per
core minus one, and every thread has its own V8 heap outside the limit set by
`--max-old-space-size`. Each of the four largest chunks (3.0 to 3.7 MB after
minification) costs about 1.4 GB while Terser holds its syntax tree, and all
four are minified at once. On a 16-core machine the webpack process peaked at
9.6 GB.

Cold production builds, measured once each on the same 16-core machine with
the Vercel `NODE_OPTIONS`:

| Minifier | Time | Peak memory | JS gzip |
| ------------------------------ | ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Terser, one worker per core | 55 s | 9.6 GB | 5.43 MB |
| Terser, `parallel: 2` | 67 s | 6.3 GB | 5.43 MB |
| Terser, `compress: false` | 54 s | 5.8 GB | 5.63 MB (+4%) |
| esbuild, `keepNames`, `es2017` | 47 s | 4.6 GB | 6.30 MB (+16%) |

We choose esbuild. It builds fastest and with the least memory, and it moves
the build towards a modern, native toolchain rather than tuning the JavaScript
one. The price is a larger bundle: 16% more gzipped JavaScript in the esbuild
measurement. We accept that price for faster builds that fit the standard
machine without Enhanced Builds.

The decision is reversible. If no way is found to bring esbuild's output close
to Terser's size, returning to Terser with a capped worker count is the
fallback; the measurements above are the baseline for that comparison.

## What Changes

- The production build minifies JavaScript with esbuild instead of Terser,
  through `terser-webpack-plugin`'s `esbuildMinify`. `esbuild` becomes a direct
  dependency of `client-v2`.
- esbuild keeps every class and function name (`keepNames`). The decorators in
  `src/utils/decorators/common.ts` derive each change-event name from the
  class name of a `_Pg*` class, and esbuild cannot keep names by pattern the
  way Terser's `keep_classnames: /^_Pg/` does.
- esbuild's output targets the production `browserslist` floor, so the
  minifier never emits syntax newer than the browsers the product supports.
- The production build no longer runs the type check
  (`ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin`) or ESLint (`ESLintWebpackPlugin`). Both keep
  running in CI (`client-v2.yml`) and in the pre-push hook (`yarn run check`). The
  development server keeps both, so type errors still show in the overlay.
- CI checks the built bundle for the `_Pg*` class names, so a minifier change
  that drops them fails the build instead of reaching users as an infinite
  loop.
- No slice under `features/` or `widgets/` changes; no telemetry event is
  added, renamed, or removed.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `client-v2-build`: what the production build of `client-v2` must produce and
  within which limits: the memory it may use, the names minification must
  keep, the browsers its output targets, and where type checking and linting
  run.

### Modified Capabilities

None.

## Impact

- `client-v2/craco.config.js`: the minimizer, the removal of the two check
  plugins in production builds.
- `client-v2/package.json`, `client-v2/yarn.lock`: `esbuild` as a direct
  development dependency.
- `client-v2/src/utils/decorators/common.ts`: the comment that explains why
  `_Pg*` names must survive names Terser; it changes to name the minifier
  setting that keeps them.
- `.github/workflows/client-v2.yml`: a step that checks the built bundle for
  the `_Pg*` class names.
- `.githooks/pre-push`, `CLAUDE.md`, `client-v2/README.md`: `yarn check`
  becomes `yarn run check`. Yarn 1's built-in `check` (it compares
  `node_modules` with `yarn.lock`) shadows the script of the same name, so the
  hook never ran the project's checks, and failed on dependency mismatches
  whatever the code held.
- Users: about 16% more gzipped JavaScript to download on first load (measured
  0.87 MB more). Cached loads are unaffected.
- Developers: a production build no longer reports type or lint errors. They
  are reported by `yarn run check`, the pre-push hook (opt-in per clone), and CI.
- Vercel: preview and production builds fit the standard build machine.
- Out of scope:
  - Shrinking esbuild's output, a future improvement: dropping `keepNames` by
    giving the decorator lookup an explicit key instead of `Function.name`, and
    splitting the largest chunks. Postponed on purpose: the larger bundle is
    accepted because builds that fit the standard machine and finish faster
    cost less per deploy. The measurements in "Why" are the baseline, and
    Terser with a capped worker count stays the fallback.
  - Replacing webpack or Create React App with a native bundler.
  - Changing `--max-old-space-size` in `vercel.json`.
  - Enhanced Builds on Vercel.
  - Source maps: production builds keep `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`.
