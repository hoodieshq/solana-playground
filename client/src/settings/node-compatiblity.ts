// This file is responsible for making sure `settings.ts` can run in a Node
// environment.
//
// Certain globals, such as `self`, `window` and `indexedDB`, only exist in
// browsers by default. This causes problems when we run `settings.ts` in Node
// environment (via `tsx`) because of how imports work. Essentially, when we
// import from `pg`, all playground libraries get imported and their codes run,
// eventually causing errors such as `ReferenceError: self is not defined`.
//
// Rather than forcing all settings to use specific paths, we just add dummy
// impls here to avoid errors. Since the problematic libraries, such as `xterm`,
// are not going to be used during setting definitions, this shouldn't have any
// adverse effects.
