# Print the connection string for this git branch's Neon branch, creating the
# branch on first use. One isolated database per preview, so two people testing
# migrations on two branches cannot corrupt each other.
#
# Previews are cut from `preview-base`, not from the project's default branch.
# Base was created while the database was still empty and nothing ever writes to
# it, so every preview starts with no schema and no rows and dbmate applies the
# whole migration history. The alternatives are both wrong: branching from the
# default branch copies production's rows into every preview, and `--schema-only`
# copies the tables but leaves `schema_migrations` empty, which makes dbmate try
# to create tables that are already there.
#
# Pass --pooled for the connection string the deployed app uses. Leave it off for
# migrations, which need a direct connection rather than the PgBouncer endpoint.
#
# `--ssl require` is explicit: dbmate refuses a URL that names no sslmode, and
# src/features/persistence/server/db.mjs would otherwise be free to connect in
# the clear.
