 * Say why a project has stopped syncing, and offer the way out.
 *
 * Mostly that means asking which copy to keep, because the failure this
 * prevents is "I opened the project on my phone and lost an afternoon on my
 * laptop". Asked only about what a merge could not settle -- lines both
 * devices changed. Anything that overlaps, or merely touches, is a question
 * rather than a guess, because a bad merge is worse than a question.
 *
 * It is the *only* place the user is asked anything. Every other outcome --
 * taking the server's copy, pushing this device's, finishing a delete -- is
 * decided by `reconcile` without involving them, because in those cases only
 * one side has work in it.
 *
 * The refusals (`name-taken`, `too-large`) are here for a different reason:
 * not because there is a choice to make, but because a project that has
 * stopped uploading is otherwise indistinguishable from one that is up to
 * date. Silence is the wrong answer to "your work is no longer being saved".
 *
 * Shown for the current workspace only, and re-read on every change to the
 * outstanding set. It used to subscribe to a raise-only event and so stayed on
 * screen for the rest of the session once triggered, including over unrelated
 * projects.
