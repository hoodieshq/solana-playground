/**
 * The resolve view's other reach past Monaco's typings (`hidden-areas.ts` is
 * the first).
 *
 * A take or a dismissal that changes where a hunk stands but no text is
 * still one step of undo: the user pressed something, and undo should take
 * that back alone. An edit cannot carry it -- Monaco drops an edit that
 * changes nothing, and its undo then fires no content event to restore the
 * hunk from -- so the step goes straight onto the model's undo stack, as an
 * element of its own whose undo and redo put the hunk back.
 *
 * The 0.37 text model keeps that stack's service as `_undoRedoService`,
 * which its `.d.ts` does not declare. A later Monaco may rename it, so it is
 * reached through this local type and nowhere else, and a missing service
 * means the step is not pushed rather than an error: the decision then
 * shares an undo step with the edit before it, as it did before.
 * `undo-step.test.ts` fails if the pinned version loses it.
