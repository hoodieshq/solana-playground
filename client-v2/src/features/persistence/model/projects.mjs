/**
 * Write a project.
 *
 * Two ways in, and a caller has to choose:
 *
 * - with `baseUpdatedAt`, a compare-and-swap. The write lands only if the row
 *   still holds the timestamp the caller read, so a device that has been away
 *   is told its write is stale rather than silently flattening whatever
 *   happened meanwhile. Postgres serialises two of these on the row lock and
 *   re-checks the predicate afterwards, so exactly one wins and the other is
 *   told about it -- assuming READ COMMITTED, the default. Under REPEATABLE
 *   READ the loser would raise a serialisation failure instead of reporting a
 *   conflict, and this would need a retry. The lock is held until commit,
 *   which is why the file writes share the transaction.
 * - without one, create-only. An existing row is reported as a conflict, not
 *   overwritten: a client that has never read cannot be allowed to win by
 *   virtue of having nothing to lose. This is also what stops a tombstoned
 *   project being resurrected by a device that never saw the delete. There
 *   are two exceptions. One is a row that holds no files -- `ensureThread`
 *   creates one so a chat turn has a parent project, so a project whose
 *   assistant was used before its first upload already exists by the time
 *   that upload arrives. Refusing it meant a project could be permanently
 *   unable to make its own first push; adopting it is safe precisely because
 *   there is no code in it to overwrite. The other is a tutorial's tombstone:
 *   a tutorial's id is derived from its name, so starting one again after
 *   deleting it can only ever arrive here, and refusing it left the restarted
 *   tutorial unable to sync at all. A tutorial is the same thing on every
 *   device, so starting it again is not the resurrection this door exists to
 *   stop. The trade is deliberate: a device holding an old run it never
 *   uploaded (started while signed out) brings that run back the same way,
 *   which keeps work rather than losing it. The run's conversations stay
 *   tombstoned either way -- bringing them back would hand the new run the
 *   old run's chat, which is what tombstoning them is for; a device still
 *   holding the old thread is told so on its next push (`ThreadDeleted`).
 *
 * A refusal says which row refused it: `reason: "deleted"` when the row is a
 * tombstone, nothing when it is a live row that has moved on. The client
 * asks the user a different question for each.
 *
 * The files are then either replaced (`files`: the whole set) or patched
 * (`changed` and `removed`: only what differs from the state the token names).
 * A patch is only ever accepted together with a token, so "what it differs
 * from" is always the row the caller read.
