 * server moved since then:
 *
 * |          | server unchanged | server moved |
 * | -------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
 * | clean    | nothing          | take server  |
 * | dirty    | push             | **merge**    |
 *
 * Both questions are answerable only because `PgSyncMark` persists what the
 * server last accepted from *this* device. Without it "local differs from the
 * server" is one undifferentiated state, and the previous version of this
 * function resolved it by always taking the server's copy -- which quietly
 * destroyed anything that had not finished uploading.
 *
 * The bottom-right cell is the only one that can ask the user anything, and
 * only about lines both copies changed: everything else merges, and for those
 * lines nothing here is entitled to pick.
 *
 * Deletes are the same shape. A project the server no longer lists, for which
 * this device holds a mark, was deleted on another device: if the local copy is
 * clean the delete finishes here, and if it is not the user is asked rather
 * than having unsaved work removed on another device's say-so.
 *
 * One pass at a time. Several things ask for one -- the session on load, the
 * explorer's first switch, a tab coming back, an adoption's re-open -- and two
 * passes that overlap each see the other's writes half made: a workspace
 * `importFresh` has created but not yet marked reads as a copy with work of
 * its own, and merging that renamed the account's row to its de-duplicated
 * local name. So a caller that arrives mid-pass waits for it, and then gets a
 * pass of its own, shared with every other caller that arrived meanwhile.
 *
 * Not the pass already running: that one may have started signed out, or
 * before the import the caller is asking about, and its `latest` and
 * `replaced` would then answer a question nobody asked. Nothing inside a pass
 * awaits `reconcile`, so waiting here cannot wait on itself -- the switch an
 * adoption's re-open dispatches starts one without awaiting it.
