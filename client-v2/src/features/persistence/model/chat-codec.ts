 * device that pulled a reply mid-stream keep the fragment for ever over the
 * finished copy the server had since been given. A tie goes to local, so an
 * item nobody has changed is left exactly as this device has it -- the very
 * same object, which is what lets the store fold a pull into a turn that is
 * still streaming into one of them.
 *
 * Versions from two devices are compared without trusting their clocks to
 * agree, and safely: a message is only ever changed by the tab running its
 * turn -- the reply streams there, and only there can an approval be answered
 * or given an outcome, because the promise it resolves lives in that tab's
 * memory and a restored card is never pending. So both copies of an id carry
 * stamps from one clock, and the comparison never crosses devices.
 *
 * Here rather than in `chat-sync`, because the store uses it too and must not
 * import the sync client to get it.
