 * A line-level merge needs three versions of a file, and the base is the one
 * that is gone once the user types: local has overwritten it, and the server
 * may have moved on too. It is only needed for files changed on *both* sides,
 * which were by definition changed here -- so keeping the pre-edit content of
 * locally edited files alone is enough. A file nobody here touched is its own
 * base. In practice the store is empty: every accepted upload clears it.
 *
 * The content comes from the *shadow*, the current workspace's files as of its
 * last open or last accepted upload. Holding it costs nothing but references,
 * since strings are shared, and it spares the explorer a hook: capture runs
 * once per push, off the files the push already knows changed, never per
 * keystroke.
 *
 * A capture that never happened -- the tab crashed before any push -- is not
 * repaired by guessing. The file is simply asked about, as a whole, which is
 * what every file was before this existed.
