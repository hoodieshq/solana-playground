/**
 * Decides between upstream's `Tutorial` (About/Start, then its own editor
 * plus markdown pane) and Flow's `LessonSurface` (editor alone) for a
 * tutorial the fork has given a lesson path.
 *
 * Whether a lesson path exists is fixed for the life of a route -- the
 * route itself checks that once, before ever rendering this component.
 * Whether the tutorial is *started* is not: `PgTutorial.start()` lives
 * inside upstream's `Tutorial` and runs well after this component has
 * mounted, so that half of the decision has to live somewhere that
 * re-renders on it. `useRenderOnChange(PgTutorial.onDidChange)` is the
 * same subscription upstream's own `Tutorial` uses to notice its own
 * `start()` call; `start()` only updates tutorial state once
 * `PgExplorer.createWorkspace()` has resolved, so `PgTutorial.isStarted`
 * already reflects the new workspace by the time this fires.
