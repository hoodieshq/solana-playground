/**
 * A verified path over upstream's `hello-anchor` tutorial.
 *
 * The prose is upstream's, loaded unedited from
 * `src/tutorials/hello-anchor/pages/`. Only the objectives, the
 * verification conditions and the hints are ours, so an upstream sync
 * keeps flowing through.
 *
 * Step 1 is satisfied only once a build has run, which is the point: you
 * find out by building, not by asserting. Step 3 is a reading step
 * because nothing free proves a client call happened -- the honest limit
 * of this cut, and the first thing log verification would fix.
