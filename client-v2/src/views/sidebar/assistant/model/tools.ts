 * building, deploying — calls `PgAssistant.requestApproval` and does not
 * return until the user clicks, which holds the agent loop open. That is
 * "propose automatically, apply explicitly" enforced inside the loop rather
 * than around it, and it works the same whichever provider is driving.
 *
 * Skill and MCP tools are appended here rather than wired per provider, so
 * every backend gets ecosystem grounding without touching its adapter.
 *
 * @param bridge the playground to act on
 * @returns vendor-neutral tool definitions
