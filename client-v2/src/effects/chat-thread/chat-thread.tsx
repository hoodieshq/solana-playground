/**
 * Keep the open conversation pointed at the current workspace, and get it to

 *
 * An app-level effect rather than something the assistant panel does, because
 * the panel is not always mounted -- it can be collapsed, or showing the
 * backend picker -- and which conversation is open must not depend on whether
 * anyone is looking at it. Otherwise a message sent right after a project
 * switch lands in the previous project's thread, or in none at all.
 *
 * Which conversation that is comes from the thread index, not from the
 * workspace id itself: a thread has an id of its own so a project can hold
 * more than one. The workspace decides which is *active*.
 *
 * Keyed by the workspace *id*, not its name: the id survives a rename, which
 * is why workspaces have one.
 *
 * Opening is two-stage on purpose. The local copy paints first so the panel is
 * never blank waiting on a network round trip, and the server's copy is folded
 * in behind it. On a deployment without sync, or signed out, the second stage
 * is a no-op and this behaves exactly as it did before.
