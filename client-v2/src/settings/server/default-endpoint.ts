/**
 * Which build server a fresh profile talks to.
 *
 * The Foundation's server in every environment, development included.
 * Upstream defaults development to a local server, but nothing in this
 * repository starts one, so the first build of a fresh checkout used to
 * fail in milliseconds against a port with nothing behind it; the
 * Foundation's server allowlists `localhost:3000`, so development can
 * reach it directly. Running a server locally is a picker entry away, or
 * `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080`.
 *
 * `||` not `??`: sourcing an env file leaves unfilled keys as "", which is
 * not nullish and would win.
 *
 * This decides the default only. A value already in `localStorage` is read
 * before defaults are applied (`utils/decorators/updatable.ts`), so a
 * profile that has stored an endpoint keeps it and the environment
 * variable does not reach it -- change it in Settings instead.
