/**
 * Better Auth's catch-all. Every `/api/auth/...` path lands here.
 *
 * Not by file name: Vercel's zero-config `api/` routing gives each file
 * exactly one route, and a bracketed segment -- `[id]`, `[...all]`, it makes no
 * difference -- compiles to `([^/]+)`, a single segment. No file can serve a
 * subtree, so `/api/auth/sign-in/social` is unreachable however it is spelled.
 * `vercel.json` rewrites the subtree here instead, which is the one mechanism
 * that spans segments. `api-routing.test.mjs` holds the rule.
 *
 * The dev server arrives the other way, dispatching on the first path segment
 * (see `resolveApiRoute` in `craco.config.js`).
