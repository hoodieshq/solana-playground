/**
 * Put a message in the open thread and wait until it is on disk.

 *
 * The store writes back without awaiting (`_persist`), and declines while no
 * thread is open -- which is the case for a moment after a workspace switch,
 * when `effects/chat-thread` has closed the old thread and not yet resolved
 * the new one. A message added in that gap is adopted by the next thread, but
 * a reload or a read in the meantime would see nothing, and that is a flaky
 * test, not a lost message. So: wait for the thread, add, wait for the file
 * -- its bytes and its directory entry, see `fileIsListed`.
 *
 * Right after a switch the *previous* thread's id is still the open one for
 * a moment, so a caller that switched passes it as `notThread` and the wait
 * is for a different, open thread -- otherwise the message lands in the old
 * project's conversation and the file check still passes.
