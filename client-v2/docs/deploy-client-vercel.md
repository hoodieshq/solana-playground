# Deploy the client to Vercel

Vercel's native Git integration auto-deploys: `master` → production; any other branch → preview. Those builds use the dashboard's Root Directory, which is still `client`, so **pushes currently deploy the upstream client, not `client-v2`**. Makefile targets exist as a local escape hatch and pin `client-v2` themselves — see [Which client gets deployed](#which-client-gets-deployed).

`installCommand` = `bash scripts/vercel-install.sh` (rustup + `wasm/build.sh` + `yarn install`); `buildCommand` = `yarn build`. Wasm must precede `yarn install` because `client-v2/package.json` has `file://../wasm/*/pkg` deps that don't exist until `wasm-pack` runs.

## Verified Vercel project settings

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Plan / Build Machine | Enterprise + **Enhanced** |
| Framework Preset | Other |
| Root Directory | `client` — intended `client-v2`, not yet changed |
| Production Branch | `master` |
| Ignored Build Step | Automatic |

## Which client gets deployed

The dashboard and the Makefile currently disagree, on purpose:

| Path | Root Directory used | Deploys |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git push` (Git integration) | dashboard: `client` | upstream client |
| `make -f client-v2/Makefile.vercel deploy-client-to-vercel-preview` | pinned to `client-v2` | the fork's client |

`vercel build` takes the built directory from `settings.rootDirectory` in `.vercel/project.json`, which `vercel pull` caches from the dashboard. `vercel.json` has no `rootDirectory` key, so the dashboard is the only source for the Git path. `vercel-link-preview` rewrites the cached value to `client-v2` after every pull — that is what makes the local target build the fork while pushes do not.

Setting the dashboard Root Directory to `client-v2` makes both paths agree; the rewrite then becomes a no-op and can be dropped.

## One-time setup

1. Create the project. Framework: Other. Root Directory: `client-v2`.
2. Build Machine: Enhanced on Enterprise; default on Pro.
3. Production Branch: `master`. Ignored Build Step: Automatic.
4. Account Settings → Tokens: team-scoped token, `export VERCEL_TOKEN=...` locally for the Makefile targets.
5. Link the local checkout (from repo root):

   ```sh
   VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_xxx make -f client-v2/Makefile.vercel vercel-bootstrap
   ```

   `-f` matters: the root `Makefile` still includes `client/Makefile.vercel`, so a bare `make <target>` runs the pre-move targets and deploys the upstream client.

Add the Vercel deployment origin to the server's [`PG_CLIENT_URLS`](https://github.com/solana-playground/solana-playground/blob/cd5555155c61572c8c49fb351890519af9e493ef/.env.example#L3) environment variable or CORS will reject every request.

## Deploy

- **Automatic:** push the branch — but this builds `client`, not `client-v2`, until the dashboard Root Directory is changed.
- **Local preview:** `VERCEL_TOKEN=<token> make -f client-v2/Makefile.vercel deploy-client-to-vercel-preview`. Promote later with `vercel promote <url> --prod`.

`vercel-link-preview` runs automatically as a prerequisite. Local production deploys are intentionally not supported — production goes out only via the `master` Git integration.

## Endpoint routing

- All non-share routes → the hardcoded Solana Foundation server URL in `client-v2/src/settings/server/server.ts` (also user-overridable via the `server.endpoint` setting), so forks can point at their own backend.
- Share routes (`/share/*`, `/new`) → hardcoded `https://api.solpg.io` so shared snippets stay discoverable across hosts.
