# stub-packages.sh — create placeholder WASM packages for UI-only development.
#
# The client depends on 8 local packages under wasm/*/pkg. Two of them
# (playnet, rustfmt) are committed prebuilt; the other 6 are compiled from
# Rust by wasm/build.sh, which takes roughly an hour. If you are only working
# on the React UI you do not need them, but `yarn install` still refuses to
# run while the directories are missing.
#
# This script writes minimal stand-ins so install and the dev build succeed.
# What you lose: Rust intellisense in the editor and the `solana`, `anchor`,
# `spl-token`, `sugar` terminal commands plus Seahorse (Python) builds.
# What still works: the whole UI, Monaco, rustfmt, Playnet (local validator),
# wallet, and Rust program builds via the build server.
#
# Usage: ./wasm/stub-packages.sh   (run from anywhere; resolves its own location)
#
# To switch back to the real thing later: rm -rf wasm/{anchor-cli,rust-analyzer,
# seahorse-compile,solana-cli,spl-token-cli,sugar-cli}/pkg && ./wasm/build.sh
#
