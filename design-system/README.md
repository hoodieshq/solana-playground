# Playground design system

shadcn/ui and Tailwind 4 in Playground's tokens. Stock shadcn where it fits. Our own components where Playground does something shadcn does not. Ours are written the way shadcn writes its own: one file in `components/ui`, compound parts, `data-slot` on every part, `cva` variants.

The product with Studio over it: https://solana-playground-ds.vercel.app/#app

## What is where

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `src/styles/tokens.css` | The tokens. `:root` is paper, `.dark` is the product |
| `src/styles/theme.css` | The tokens as Tailwind utilities, and the product utilities: `frosted`, `gradient-stroke`, `brand-action` |
| `src/components/ui/` | 60 stock shadcn components, untouched, and 26 of ours |
| `src/hooks/use-indicator.ts` | The measured thumb that Stepper and Segmented slide |
| `src/ds/` | The page itself: foundations, one block per component, the migration map |
| `registry.json` | Our components, for `npx shadcn add` |
| `studio/` | Studio's config for Playground, filled in from the `data-slot` names at build time |

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

`npm run build` builds the page, its snapshot, `ds-inject.css` and the registry. The snapshot drives Chromium through the Playwright that `client-v2` installs for its e2e tests, so install `client-v2` first, or point `PLAYWRIGHT` at another copy's `index.mjs`.

## Building and publishing

```bash
bash scripts/site.sh
```

That builds the page, snapshots it, builds `ds-inject.css` and the registry, then puts them on one site with the product and Studio and deploys it to Vercel (hoodies). Use `NO_DEPLOY=1` to assemble only.

The page ships with a snapshot of itself in `index.html`. Studio reads the specimens by fetching the page without running it, so they have to be in the HTML.

## Using ours in client-v2

From `client-v2`, `yarn ds-add <name...>` does all of the below in one step: it builds the registry, serves it, installs with `--overwrite` and stops the server (`client-v2/CLAUDE.md`, "Components"). The manual route, for any other consumer:

Installs come from the repo, not from the public site. Our items depend on each other as `@playground/<name>`, and the consumer says where `@playground` lives. Build the registry and serve it:

```bash
npm run build:registry
npm run registry:serve        # http://127.0.0.1:3010/r, PORT to change it
```

Map the namespace in the consumer's `components.json`:

```json
"registries": {
  "@playground": "http://127.0.0.1:3010/r/{name}.json"
}
```

Then the tokens first, then any component:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @playground/playground-tokens
npx shadcn@latest add @playground/stepper
```

`@playground/playground` installs everything at once. The stock shadcn components ours build on (`button`, `spinner`, `tooltip`) still come from the shadcn registry. Then import `playground-tokens.css` and `playground-theme.css` after `tailwindcss` in the app's CSS, and put `dark` on `<html>`.

Current shadcn needs React 19: it passes `ref` as a plain prop, and React 17 drops it. So client-v2 moves to React 19 before the first component.

Two of ours need more than the copied files. `message-scroller` and `questionnaire` import the runtime package `@shadcn/react`, which needs React 19; it becomes a dependency of client-v2 when the first of them is installed. `combobox` alone is built on `@base-ui/react`, not Radix; the first ticket that needs a combobox decides whether Base UI stays or the combobox is rebuilt on Radix, so the client carries one set of primitives.

## How Studio connects

- The Add tab reads every `[data-ds-block]` on the page. The title is its `h4`, and the specimens are the children of its first `.row`.
- On the product, Studio links `ds-inject.css`, so a specimen added there wears the system's clothes. That stylesheet has no global reset, and its utilities sit outside any layer, so they win over the product's bare element rules.
- Picking anything with a `data-slot` names it by that slot, and its variant by `data-variant`, `data-size` or `data-status`.
- The Design tab's tokens and choices write CSS variables, so everything built on the system follows at once.
